QUESTIONS:
 * Would it make sense to dedicate a second thread in the "single-threaded" server to listen for new connections?

FUTURE WORK:
 * (multithreaded version) Have client-serving threads remove themselves from
    the pthread list after exiting (would need to use a mutex to lock the pthread list).
