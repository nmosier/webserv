CS 315 Final Project: Web Server -- README
Author: Nicholas Mosier
Date: 12/17/2018

OVERVIEW:
There are multiple parts to the source code:
      * libwebserv: a library for creating a web server. It provides functions for starting up the server,
                    accepting connections, reading in requests, sending responses, etc. All sending and
                    receiving is asynchronous. The source code for this library is contained in the folder
                    "webserv-lib". It has its own Makefile, which builds the shared object library
                    libwebserv.so. 


QUESTIONS:
 * Would it make sense to dedicate a second thread in the "single-threaded" server to listen for new connections?

FUTURE WORK:
 * (multithreaded version) Have client-serving threads remove themselves from
    the pthread list after exiting (would need to use a mutex to lock the pthread list).
